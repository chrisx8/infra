# Firefly III has two options for user authentication. "eloquent" is the default,

# It's also possible to change the way users are authenticated.

# If the guard is changed, Firefly III uses the 'REMOTE_USER' header as per RFC 3875.
# Some systems use X-Auth headers. In that case, use HTTP_X_AUTH_USERNAME or HTTP_X_AUTH_EMAIL
# Depending on your system, REMOTE_USER may need to be changed to HTTP_REMOTE_USER
# If this header is 'unexpectedly empty', check out the documentation.
